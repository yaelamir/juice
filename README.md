#Juicy

###Welcome to Juicy!

##About the App
Juicy is a juice ordering app, where you can customize your own juice, then immediately see the nutrition facts for your juice. It was important to me to give customers the ability to see the nutrition facts for the juices since one of the issues of typical juice companies is that there's an assumption that juices are always healthy and therefore unnecessary to check the nutrition it contains. If the customer makes a juice that has a high sugar content, for example, they can always go back and remake their juice. My goal was to make a clean and practical app that can be used by anyone.

##Design
My goal was to design a user friendly app that has a clean a concise design in order for the user to have the simplest ordering experience. Users can view information about the app before logging in. If they would like to order they must either log in or create an account. Once they do so they are navigated to the home page. They then can choose to order they're customized juice by choosing the ingredients and size then a pick or order time and date.
